I am a postdoctoral research at <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en/'>EPFL</a>, within the <a href='https://indy.epfl.ch/'>INDY lab</a>, working in collaboration with <a href='https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran'>Prof. Patrick Thiran</a>. My current research focuses on Bayesian Optimization, from its theoretical guarantees to its application to various contexts (e.g., dynamic, high-dimensional, distributed) and domains (e.g., wireless networks, community detection).

Formerly, I was a Ph.D. student at <a href='https://www.ens-lyon.fr/'>École Normale Supérieure (ENS) Lyon</a>, within the <a href='https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/index.php/research/hownet-team'>HoWNet team</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/thomas.begin/'>Prof. Thomas Begin</a>. I was researching online high-dimensional black-box optimization techniques, with an extensive application to next generation wireless networks (<em>e.g.</em> Wi-Fi, 5G).

My research interests include black-box optimization (especially Bayesian optimization), online learning, performance evaluation and wireless networks.
