  abstract        = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) is typically used to optimize an unknown function $f$ that is noisy and costly to evaluate, by exploiting an acquisition function that must be maximized at each optimization step. Even if provably asymptotically optimal BO algorithms are efficient at optimizing low-dimensional functions, scaling them to high-dimensional spaces remains an open problem, often tackled by assuming an additive structure for $f$. By doing so, BO algorithms typically introduce additional restrictive assumptions on the additive structure that reduce their applicability domain. This paper contains two main contributions: (i) we relax the restrictive assumptions on the additive structure of $f$ \textit{without} weakening the maximization guarantees of the acquisition function, and (ii) we address the over-exploration problem for decentralized BO algorithms. To these ends, we propose DuMBO, an asymptotically optimal decentralized BO algorithm that achieves very competitive performance against state-of-the-art BO algorithms, especially when the additive structure of $f$ comprises high-dimensional factors.},

  abstract        = {Network Digital Twin (NDT) and Network Simulation (NS) are two paradigms leveraging virtual representations of networks to help decision-making. These tools may seem similar or interchangeable and are often confused or opposed. However, they have their respective purposes, use cases and underlying concepts, which differ and are complementary. The goal of this article is to explore and clarify the specificity, the benefits and the limits of these two decision support tools, analyze how they complement each other and can be nicely combined. We argue that a smart integration of NS in NDT, named NS+NDT, can ease, accelerate and strength decisions for network design, deployment, operations, management and evolution. To study and demonstrate this claim, we focus on the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, where wireless networks are critical for connecting the physical assets to the Internet, but are complicated to configure for meeting the requirements of a specific application. We examine how NS, coupled with NDT, can contribute to support IoT architects and operators decisions throughout the life cycle of an IoT network. We analyse the different steps required to use NS in the context of NDT and examine how this helps remove NS barriers such as credibility and reliability. In particular, we show how NDT data enable to fine tune and customize the energy consumption models, making the simulation results more context-aware and insightful. Then, addressing the often-prohibitive simulation cost for exploring a large parameter space, we propose to associate surrogate modeling to NS+NDT. As surrogate models, we first introduce a simple ML (Machine Learning)-based surrogate model and illustrate this method with two IoT network configuration optimization use cases. Secondly, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach based on Gaussian Processes as surrogate model to further accelerate the (re)configuration decisions. We show how this method enables to select simulation scenarios that converge rapidly to the optimal solution, and allows the NDT to timely perform the adaptation. The contribution of this article is threefold. It provides i) the first systematic analysis of the differences and potential synergies between NDT and NS; ii) a synthetic presentation of the integration of NS and associated decision algorithms within a NDT to unlock NS accessibility and credibility throughout the life cycle of an IoT solution; iii) a proposal for a smart and cost-efficient integration of NS in NDT via surrogate modeling, for reducing evaluation and optimization cost, paving the way to NS-augmented NDT-based dynamic adaptation and real-time optimization of IoT networks.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, wireless networks (WNs) are ubiquitous and have to increase the density of their deployment to meet our important connectivity needs. Paradoxically, this deteriorates their quality of service because they have to deal with a larger amount of interference. To manage this unprecedented complexity, wireless standards, such as Wi-Fi or 5G, are becoming more flexible by introducing new degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, the correct exploitation of these parameters is not trivial because it requires to quickly identify an efficient configuration in a high-dimensional space. Moreover, the wide variety of use cases of WNs makes it difficult to model their behaviors, and consequently to find an optimal configuration analytically. In this thesis, we propose bandit and Bayesian optimization methods able to discover, through trial and error, an efficient configuration of WNs regardless of their deployments. These sequential learning methods, called "online", seek to optimize the performance of a WN by considering it as a black box. In this thesis, we illustrate the capabilities of the proposed methods on the challenging problem of spatial reuse optimization in Wi-Fi networks, and on the power control in 5G networks. Finally, we propose a new asymptotically optimal Bayesian optimization algorithm, able to optimize a high-dimensional black box function in a decentralized fashion. This last contribution could allow the implementation of more efficient protocols in WNs but also in other technological contexts.},

  abstract        = {WLANs, which have overtaken wired networks to become the primary means of connecting devices to the Internet, are prone to performance issues due to the scarcity of space in the radio spectrum. As a response, IEEE 802.11ax and subsequent amendments aim at increasing the spatial reuse of a radio channel by allowing the dynamic update of two key parameters in wireless transmission: the transmission power (TX_POWER) and the sensitivity threshold (OBSS_PD). In this paper, we present INSPIRE, a distributed online learning solution performing local Bayesian optimizations based on Gaussian processes to improve the spatial reuse in WLANs. INSPIRE makes no explicit assumptions about the topology of WLANs and favors altruistic behaviors of the access points, leading them to find adequate configurations of their TX_POWER and OBSS_PD parameters for the "greater good" of the WLANs. We demonstrate the superiority of INSPIRE over other state-of-the-art strategies using the ns-3 simulator and two examples inspired by real-life deployments of dense WLANs. Our results show that, in only a few seconds, INSPIRE is able to drastically increase the quality of service of operational WLANs by improving their fairness and throughput.},

In this paper, we use the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to propose a centralized solution to dynamically adapt these parameters. We propose a new approach based on a Gaussian mixture to sample new network configurations, a specific reward function that prevents starvations when maximized, as well as a method based on Thompson Sampling to select the best network configuration. We evaluate our solution using the network simulator ns-3 and different topologies. Simulation results confirm the large benefits that 802.11ax may bring to spatial reuse. They also demonstrate the efficiency of our solution in finding appropriate parameter configurations that significantly improve the quality of service of the networks.}

Among the main purposes of 802.11ax is the improvement of the spatial reuse of radio channels by allowing the dynamical update of the sensitivity threshold and the transmission power at each node. In this regard, our contributions are twofold. First, we investigate the performance improvement resulting from a more efficient spatial reuse of radio channels with 802.11ax. Second, we introduce a centralized solution based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework and a sub-sampling technique to quickly discover an appropriate configuration of the sensitivity threshold and transmission power at each access point.

This resorts to the new ability for APs (Access Points) to dynamically modify their transmission power as well as the signal energy threshold beyond which they consider the radio channel to be free or busy. In general, selecting adequate values for these parameters is complex because of (i) the high dimensionality of the problem and (ii) the uncertainty of the radio environment. To overcome these difficulties, we frame this problem as a MAB (Multi-Armed Bandit) problem and propose an efficient and robust solution using Thompson sampling, an original sampling of WLAN configurations, and a tailor-made reward function. We evaluate the efficiency of our solution as well as several other ones with scenarios inspired by real-life WLANs' deployments using the network simulator ns-3. The numerical results show the ability of our solution along with its superiority over the others at finding adequate parameterization at each AP thereby significantly improving the overall performance of WLANs.}
