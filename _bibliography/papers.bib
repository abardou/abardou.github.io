  abstract        = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) is typically used to optimize an unknown function $f$ that is noisy and costly to evaluate, by exploiting an acquisition function that must be maximized at each optimization step. Although provably asymptotically optimal BO algorithms are efficient at optimizing low-dimensional functions, scaling them to high-dimensional spaces remains an open research problem, often tackled by assuming an additive structure for $f$. However, such algorithms introduce additional restrictive assumptions on the additive structure that reduce their applicability domain. In this paper, we relax the restrictive assumptions on the additive structure of $f$, at the expense of weakening the maximization guarantees of the acquisition function, and we address the over-exploration problem for decentralized BO algorithms. To these ends, we propose DumBO, an asymptotically optimal decentralized BO algorithm that achieves very competitive performance against state-of-the-art BO algorithms, especially when the additive structure of $f$ does not exist or comprises high-dimensional factors.},

  abstract        = {WLANs, which have overtaken wired networks to become the primary means of connecting devices to the Internet, are prone to performance issues due to the scarcity of space in the radio spectrum. As a response, IEEE 802.11ax and subsequent amendments aim at increasing the spatial reuse of a radio channel by allowing the dynamic update of two key parameters in wireless transmission: the transmission power (TX_POWER) and the sensitivity threshold (OBSS_PD). In this paper, we present INSPIRE, a distributed online learning solution performing local Bayesian optimizations based on Gaussian processes to improve the spatial reuse in WLANs. INSPIRE makes no explicit assumptions about the topology of WLANs and favors altruistic behaviors of the access points, leading them to find adequate configurations of their TX_POWER and OBSS_PD parameters for the "greater good" of the WLANs. We demonstrate the superiority of INSPIRE over other state-of-the-art strategies using the ns-3 simulator and two examples inspired by real-life deployments of dense WLANs. Our results show that, in only a few seconds, INSPIRE is able to drastically increase the quality of service of operational WLANs by improving their fairness and throughput.},

In this paper, we use the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to propose a centralized solution to dynamically adapt these parameters. We propose a new approach based on a Gaussian mixture to sample new network configurations, a specific reward function that prevents starvations when maximized, as well as a method based on Thompson Sampling to select the best network configuration. We evaluate our solution using the network simulator ns-3 and different topologies. Simulation results confirm the large benefits that 802.11ax may bring to spatial reuse. They also demonstrate the efficiency of our solution in finding appropriate parameter configurations that significantly improve the quality of service of the networks.}

Among the main purposes of 802.11ax is the improvement of the spatial reuse of radio channels by allowing the dynamical update of the sensitivity threshold and the transmission power at each node. In this regard, our contributions are twofold. First, we investigate the performance improvement resulting from a more efficient spatial reuse of radio channels with 802.11ax. Second, we introduce a centralized solution based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework and a sub-sampling technique to quickly discover an appropriate configuration of the sensitivity threshold and transmission power at each access point. We evaluate our solution with the network simulator ns-3 on different network topologies. The simulation results show the ability of our solution to quickly and robustly adjust these parameters of access points in order to significantly improve the behavior of WLANs.},

  abstract        = {With the recent 802.11ax amendment to the IEEE standard commercialized as Wi-Fi 6, WLANs have the potential to greatly improve the spatial reuse of radio channels. This resorts to the new ability for APs (Access Points) to dynamically modify their transmission power as well as the signal energy threshold beyond which they consider the radio channel to be free or busy. In general, selecting adequate values for these parameters is complex because of (i) the high dimensionality of the problem and (ii) the uncertainty of the radio environment. To overcome these difficulties, we frame this problem as a MAB (Multi-Armed Bandit) problem and propose an efficient and robust solution using Thompson sampling, an original sampling of WLAN configurations, and a tailor-made reward function. We evaluate the efficiency of our solution as well as several other ones with scenarios inspired by real-life WLANs' deployments using the network simulator ns-3. The numerical results show the ability of our solution along with its superiority over the others at finding adequate parameterization at each AP thereby significantly improving the overall performance of WLANs.}
